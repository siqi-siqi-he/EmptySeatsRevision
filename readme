This is the code written for paper: Dynamic Pricing of Extra Seats under the Nested Logit Model

There are three choice settings: choice=0: seats are homogeneous to the customer. choice=1: seats are heterogeneous to
the customers (preference increases with index). choice=2: customers have two different preferences for window seats and
aisle seats.

The main directory consists the following parts:

1. The code to run ADP (or AFF in the submission version of the paper). In order to run ADP to get the results in the
submission, execute ADP_BB.py. The coefficients generated by this python file are saved to directory BB_test.

2. The code to run DLP (or DPP in the submission version of the paper). In order to run DLP, execute DLP_norm.py. The
coefficients generated by this python file are saved to directory SBD_NL.

3. The code to run DBD (or DPD in the submission version of the paper). In order to run DBD, execute DBD_NL0.py (for
choice=0), DBD_NL1 (choice 1), DBD_NL2 (choice 2). The coefficients are saved to DBD_NL folder.

4. The code to run DBD_ke (DPD-Benchmark in paper). Execute DBD_NL_ke.py. There are also three files corresponding to
three different choices. The coefficients are saved to DBD_NL_ke folder.

5. The code to run SBD (or SDPD in paper). Execute SBD_NL.py. The coefficients are saved to SBD_NL folder.

6. The code to run SBD_ke (SDPD-Benchmark in paper). Execute SBD_NL_ke.py. The results are saved to SBD_NL_ke folder.

7. For each of the 6 methods mentioned above, there are also simulations using the corresponding results from those
files. They are called "X_simu.py", where X is the name of the method. All the simulations read from the folder
"RandomNumbers" to make sure that they are running on common random numbers.

8. In order to get the graphs for the submitted paper, run decomposition_plot.py, decomposition_runtime_plot.py

9. The directory EmptySeatsStudy corresponds to 6.3 and 6.4 section in the paper. It is similar to the codes in the main
directory, only difference is, the EmptySeatsStudy computes only on bus of 8 seats, but with more choice scenarios. To
get the graph in the paper, run plot.py and ticket_number_plot.py
