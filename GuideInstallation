Installation can be distinguished as system-wide and user-based. If you install it on your pc, you can choose either of
them. But on the amplmachine (server), only user-based installation is possible.

Here is a list of solvers you need to install:

1. cplex: (academic version)
    A. system-wide installation on your pc:
    In order to get an academic license
    https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ai-datascience/blogs/xavier-nodet1/2020/07/09/cplex-free-for-students
    https://www.ibm.com/academic/
    Here is the guide on installation.
    https://github.com/academic-initiative/documentation/tree/main/academic-initiative/how-to/How-to-download-IBM-ILOG-CPLEX
    Once it's installed, you can install the Python API:
    https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/20.1.0?topic=cplex-setting-up-python-api

    B. user-wide installation on the server:
    Since the cplex studio is already installed on the server, all we need to do is to install the python API.
    https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/20.1.0?topic=cplex-setting-up-python-api
    1. installed python 3.8.10 in my user home
    2. changed to the clpex folder where setup.py resides
    3. called setup.py build --build-base="C:\Users\siqhe\Documents\cplex" install
        !: this means you write:
            C:\Program Files\IBM\ILOG\CPLEX_Studio201\python>setup.py build --build-base="C:\Users\siqhe\Documents\cplex" install
        in your cmd. Be sure to replace siqhe with your own user name.
    4. waited until finished

2. mosek:
    mosek is used in cvxpy to solve convex optimization problem. Certain disciplined convex programming rules need to be
    fulfilled in order to run cvx and mosek. For further information, see the other guide in dcp. For general information
    on using different solvers (including mosek) in cvxpy, see
    https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/solvers/index.html

    General information about mosek with academic license, and also to get an academic license, see the link below:
